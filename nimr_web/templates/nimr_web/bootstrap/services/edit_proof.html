                                We have helped many senior academics including professors and researchers by
                                proofreading their written work prior to dissemination and publication. Our dedicated
                                team of journal editors and proofreaders will give you more confidence in the work that
                                you submit to accredited journals worldwide and presenting in various platforms. In the
                                area of publications, the author instructions provided by academic and scientific
                                journals must be followed with precision when preparing a scholarly article or the paper
                                may be rejected without serious consideration of its content; the same problem can arise
                                if an article written in the English language contains too many grammar, spelling and
                                punctuation errors. Our academic and scientific editors and proofreaders can help you to
                                ensure that this does not happen to your manuscripts by resolving any grammatic errors,
                                adjusting and formatting the references to conform consistently to journal requirements,
                                and correcting simple typing errors.


                                HSSRF guarantees absolute confidentiality and privacy of all documents submitted.
                                Additionally, we go extra mile to ensure that our ICT incorporates the latest secured
                                devices and software including encryption.
